# weather-dashboard-bootcamp-challenge-8

## Description

A Weather Dashboard app built using the Open Weather API. This is the eighth assignment in the Front-end Skills Bootcamp. For this assignment, we have been tasked with develping a weather app which retrieves data using different APIs.


I used the DayJs API to get the dates and the Open Weather API to get the weather data.



This assignment taught me how to effectively use and manipulate data retrieved via APIs.
